*Why should we learn Fortran? or Should I learn Fortran? Is it obsolete?
  A: Fortran is a good language for scientific programming, because it is fast, is good at handling arrays, is standardized, is portable, and because many high-quality libraries of numerical algorithms exist. The language itself is also maintained; the latest version of the Fortran language is Fortran 2008 (approved by ISO/IEC in September 2010).
